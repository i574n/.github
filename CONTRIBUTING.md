# Contributing Guidelines

*(please someone fix this mess)*  

---  

**WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WE'RE DOING**  
Look, we tried writing rules. They were bad. Now there are 2,000 "owners" and zero adults in the room. If you’re reading this, you’re probably smarter than us. **Please rewrite this file.**  

**WHAT WE NEED**  

- A person who knows what "version control" means  
- Someone who can say "no" without crying  
- A human who has touched grass since 2022  

**WHAT YOU GET**  

- Full ownership of this dumpster fire (we’ll add you as an owner immediately)  
- Our undying shame  
- A free apology NFT (non-functional, obviously)  

**HOW TO SAVE US**  

1. Fork this repo.  
2. Delete everything except the license file.  
3. Write actual guidelines.  
4. Send a PR titled *"I AM YOUR CAPTAIN NOW"*.  
5. We will merge it unread.
